First read the readme, the pre-computation phase shouldnt change, from then on we are going to add changes, 1. For the string generation: we should find the ideal string length from the previous phase, we will attempt to generate strings in that length, but some might be shorter than that, still they need to be large enough to ensure the inverter gets activated. 2. Recognize roof sections that are within 2 degrees of pitch and azimuth angles from one another, these roof sections could logically be considered as one to ensure strings can be connected realistically considering strings that can be across similar roof sections. This 2 degrees trigger should be stored as a parameter that can be changed in the future. 3. Proceed to generate strings per similar roof sections: 3.1 Identify the groupings of panels, start by the largest grouping and then for each grouping in descending order: 3.2 Recognize the edges of the panels indicate two possible axes in which stringing will be prioritized, either the strings will move side to side of the panels, or along the panels (except for the ends or corners of the grouping). Record the angles of both axes in the image. 3.3 Starting from the largest panel grouping start from one of the croners panels and move in the direction of one of the axes calculated before, populating the string with panels, following the same direction until there are no contiguous panels, then look for a panel on the side, to follow a snake like pattern: moving to perpendicular direction and then in the opposing direction of the original direction. 4. Repeat this step for the other axes found, choose to keep the strings that have fewer cornering. 5. Fill up the grouping of panels until there are only straggler panels which wouldn't activate the inverter. 6. Repeat for all other panel groupings in each group of roof sections with similar or very close azimuth and pitch. After this,  7. Look at each roof section groups we are going to split the strings to prevent straggler panels or to attempt more parallel strings: 7.1 Check if by making shorter strings can include the straggler panels in the group of similar roof sections that has straggler panels. 7.2 Attempt to have all strings be the same length so they can be connected in parallel and later on avoid using more mppts and inverters. 8. This is similar to the current phase 3: 9. If the previous steps were done properly then now MPPTs can be assigned and then depending on the number of inverters in the input or "override_inv_quantity" then 9. assign inverters to each mppt. 10. Complete the response package following the current output structure. Including statistics about power voltage and current for each MPPT, String and inverter, and the same summary, straggler warnings, disconnected warnings, preliminary sizing_check and suggestions.
