PHASE 1: TEMPERATURE ADJUSTMENT CALCULATIONS:
   ├── Coldest Day Voltage: Voc(-42.8°C) = -0.286 × (-42.8) + 107.143 = 119.4%
   ├── Hottest Day Voltage: Voc(56.7°C) = -0.286 × 56.7 + 107.143 = 90.9%
   ├── Max String Voltage: 52.79V × 1.194 = 63.03V per panel
   ├── Min String Voltage: 52.79V × 0.909 = 47.99V per panel
   └── Safety Factor: Ensures no inverter damage in extreme cold

PHASE 2: STRING GENERATION & VALIDATION:
   ├── Max String Length: 600V ÷ 63.03V = 9.5 panels (max 9 panels)
   ├── Min String Length: 90V ÷ 47.99V = 1.9 panels (min 2 panels)
   ├── Valid String Lengths: 2-9 panels per string
   ├── Current Limits: 12.5A per MPPT, 14.19A per panel
